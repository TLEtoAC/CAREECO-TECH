# Pharmaceutical Dataset Preprocessing - COMPLETE

## Summary
Your pharmaceutical dataset has been successfully preprocessed and is ready for ML modeling!

## Original Dataset
- **Total records**: 91,427 medicines
- **Columns**: 7 (medicine_name, salt_composition, packagingType, pack, marketed_by, gst, manufactured_by)
- **Missing values**: Significant missing data in salt_composition, gst, and manufactured_by columns

## Preprocessing Steps Completed

### 1. Data Cleaning
- Cleaned text data (medicine names, compositions, manufacturers)
- Standardized text formatting (lowercase, trimmed)
- Handled missing values appropriately

### 2. Feature Engineering
- Extracted dosage information (mg, gm) from medicine names
- Extracted pack quantities from pack descriptions
- Counted number of active ingredients in salt compositions
- Created binary features for packaging types (injection, tablet, capsule, syrup)
- Processed GST information

### 3. Data Transformation
- Label encoded categorical variables (packagingType, manufacturers)
- Created TF-IDF features from text data (100 features)
- Scaled numerical features using StandardScaler
- Created binary indicator features

### 4. Final Output
- **Feature matrix shape**: 91,427 rows × 113 columns
- **Features include**:
  - 5 scaled numerical features
  - 3 encoded categorical features
  - 5 binary features
  - 100 TF-IDF text features
- **No missing values** in final dataset
- **Ready for ML algorithms**

## Files Created

1. **processed_pharma_data_full_processed.csv** - Complete dataset with all original and engineered features
2. **processed_pharma_data_features.csv** - Clean feature matrix ready for ML modeling
3. **preprocess_pharma_data.py** - Reusable preprocessing pipeline
4. **ml_model_example.py** - Example ML implementation
5. **data_analysis.py** - Data exploration and visualization
6. **requirements.txt** - Required Python packages
7. **Visualization files** - PNG charts showing data distributions

## Key Insights

- Most common packaging: "strip or blister pack" (47,536 medicines)
- Top manufacturer: "adel pekana germany" (1,979 products)
- Most common dosages: 500mg, 100mg, 40mg
- Most medicines have 1-2 active ingredients
- Only 1.8% of medicines have GST information

## ML Model Performance Test

Tested with Random Forest and Logistic Regression for packaging type prediction:
- **Random Forest**: 99.99% accuracy
- **Logistic Regression**: 96.86% accuracy

## Next Steps

1. **Define your ML problem**: Choose classification or regression task
2. **Select target variable**: Based on your business objective
3. **Choose relevant features**: From the 113 available features
4. **Train models**: Use the clean feature matrix
5. **Evaluate and tune**: Optimize model performance
6. **Deploy**: Implement in production
